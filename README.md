## Project 1: Dashboard for house-buying company
This company operates in a home buying and selling market and its profitability comes from the opportunity to buy homes lower than they actually cost.
The purpose of the code is to provide an interactive dashboard so the CEO can query houses according to:
 - Zip code;
 - Price; 
 - Size of the house.
